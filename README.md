Heap-Manager
============
I implemented a basic heap manager for an assignment for my course CS 310: Operating Systems at Duke University. If you are taking that course, please do not view the code. Please do not copy or use this code for any graded work. 

The requirements for this assignment can be viewed in the lab1.pdf file. I have also attached the Readme document that I submitted for this assignment. My code is present in dmm.c The dmm.h file was provided by the instructors. The test_stress.c and the test_stress_time.c files were also provided by the instructors for testing purposes.
